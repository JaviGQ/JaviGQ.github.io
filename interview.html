    <p>
    At the level of play I am currently involved with within League of Legends, I have had the ability to meet and interact with various professionals and experts for the game. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        Having played with well known players such as Aphromoo, ZionSpartan, and Dyrus has opened the doors for more networking. Through these connections I was able to inteview an old veteran of the game, who has been playing since closed beta. This man has seen the game transform from the small, single map MOBA it once was into the massive worldwide phenoemenon it is today. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And this is Justin Rafanan, or as he is known in-game, MerelyAsian.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Below is the interview.

<div id="interview_text">
    
<p>Javier Gil: Hey Justin. How are you? </p> 
<p>Justin Rafana: I'm doing alright. And yourself?</p>
<p>JG: I'm doing well, doing well. You ready to start?</p>
<p>JR: As ready as I'm going to be, haha</p>
<p>JG: Alright, alright. So when did you start playing League of Legends?</p>
<p>JR: You want to ask me this question?</p>
<p>JG: Of course!</p>
<p>JR: Hmm, when did it come out? Almost 4 years ago? </p>
<p>JG: Yeah, back in 2009. You started in beta, right?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, the very early stages. Back when Twisted Fate was ridiculous with his 60 second Destiny. Back when I had to wait every week to play new champions. Yeah I remember that! Every week I would be anxious say to myself, "Who can I play this week? Oh man I get to Blitzcrank!" And all my friends and I tried to get a team of the only 6300 IP champions. Since there were only 5. So we made a team - It took us a long while to grind the IP for them, but we finally did it. So we were running around with the 5 champs... They were, uh.. Blitzcrank, Corki, Anivia... Karthus.. Who else was 6300... Back in the day. Do you remember?</p>
<p>JG: And Twitch!</p>
<p>JR: And Twitch! That was the team! Pretty bad team, but hey, back then no one really cared! That was back when I Clarity/Teleport Karthus and wrecked everyone anyway.</p>
<p>JG: Just replace Clarity with Revive and you're PhantomL0rd.</p>
<p>JR: Haha, right? </p>
<p>JG: Well, you've been playing since Beta, but what prompted you to even try League in the first place? I mean, you must've been a Sophomore in High School.</p>
<p>JR: It was actually my friend Martin who got me into League. Which is funny since he's, uh... terrible. I mean.. He's not terrible, he's just... silver. Haha! But Martin and I played games together, and he found the game and got me to play it. But I'll tell you a story, though. I even wrote about this for my college essays. </p>
<p>So I was a part of band and the math team in high school, right? They're completely different groups of people, so I had friend on the math team and friends in band. When League came around I got all my friends to start playing. So I had my friends from math become really good friends with the guys from band. But it was just a way for both my groups of friends to become a collective circle of friends.</p>
<p>JG: So League became a sort of liaison for your two friend groups.</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, and it was really nice. And I didn't really have a way for the two to hang out before. And I always felt like a jerk since I had to choose between the two. It was always that I had to choose between hanging out with one or the other, but with League I got both. Which was really nice. I mean, I got to hang out with all my friends and just play video games which was pretty awesome. </p>
<p>JG: I can relate all too well. Well tell me a bit, then, about your journey improving as a player. How did you start? What role did you play? What attracted you the most right of the bat, is what I'm saying, and how has that changed?</p>
<p>JR: I actually played DOTA a whole bunch - that's partially why I stuck with League actually. But I don't play DOTA now since, uh, DOTA 2 sucks, haha. Well it doesn't suck, but it just doesn't suit me anymore. But when I started I played Tristana and Karthus. That was pretty much it. I remember playing those since Tristana reminded me of a character in DOTA and Karthus was just so strong. Back then no one knew how to dodge skittles. And I played Katarina. I remember it was always AD mid, and 2 top and 2 bottom. I remember when people first learned about jungling. Sometimes it would still be 2 top and 2 bottom, but whenever we'd get a jungler I'd be the one to say, "Don't worry guys, I'll go 1v2 top." And I'd 1v2 as Kat. And for the longest time, until we got paired with better players, I would always get a double kill at level 6. No one knew how to CC Katarina, and there wasn't even much CC with only 40 champions. But then the meta shifted, since jungling became more popular. My experience getting better... I think it started as an unspoken competition between my friends. And it only got worse when he heard about ELO. After we heard about the ranking system we heard one of our friends was actually in the top 500 and we all just started to strive to get better and beat one another. As soon as Season 1 rolled around, it was a fierce silent competition about who would end with the highest ELO, and of course it'd be me. I'm a very competitive person, and that little contest between friends strove me to become better. </p>
<p>JG: So you started getting better at first just to bear your friends?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, pretty much.</p>
<p>JG: And did you win?</p>
<p>JR: Haha, I think I did. Back when you could still actually see ELO. </p>
<p>JG: Did anything else motivate you to get better after that?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah there actually was! It was actually this one streamer, who at the time was actually the only streamer. HotshotGG. I used to watch that guy when he only had like 50 viewers and I followed him until he had thousands and thousands. I love that guy; it's why I'm such a big CLG fan. Watching him play, since I knew he was good, and that made me want to get better. I used to watch streams all the time and that's how I got better, I think. Watching streams you get to see their mistakes and watch how they play, and using that you can improve your own game. Like, when you play you may miss your mistakes, but when you watch someone else you can see how you can be doing better. That's another thing that encouraged me to keep playing and get better as a player. But then came college...</p>
<p>JG: Oh boy...</p>
<p>JR: Seriously, haha. Well, this was Season 2, I think. And then there's GatorLAN. It was the very first GatorLAN, too, I think. And my friends and I decided, "Hey, we've been playing for a while. Why don't we compete?" And we won. By miles. And we played in the next GatorLAN and we won again. And we kept winning and winning. And this was back when the prizes were actually good, like mice, tower cases, and Riot points on top of it all. I had played in GatorLAN since it started until this last one.</p>
<p>JG: Why didn't you play?</p>
<p>JR: The prizes were awful and my team just didn't feel motivated to compete this time. But GatorLAN is another thing that kept me motivated to get better. Since we had actual competition and we wanted to win prizes we had to improve. Oh, and we did IvyLoL. We played for the UF team and we got to the semifinals, I think. But then we got rolled by some pros, or something. But it's alright.</p>
<p>JG: So, you'd say it was after you got into college that you got more serious about League?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, with GatorLAN and IvyLoL I felt more inspired to get serious about it. I mean, there were prizes and prize money that we could win, just for playing a game we love to play. I was said to my friends, "We can win stuff, and all we'd have to do is practice a bit and we can win." But yeah, it was definitely after college that I got more serious about it. </p>
<p>JG: What role did you play back then?</p>
<p>JR: I actually played support. Back then, though, it didn't really matter. We could play anything and we'd win. But I started in the jungle I think, until we got a legitimate jungler. And then one of my close friends and I started playing bot together and that's when I started to main support. I played support for the entire season after that. So I guess you can say I used to main support, and I guess jungle. </p>
<p>JG: So when did you start ranked?</p>
<p>JR: Back in Seasons 1.</p>
<p>JG: And what ELO did you end with?</p>
<p>JR: I think I was around 1500, so Gold.</p>
<p>JG: And season 2?</p>
<p>JR: I peaked at 2050 or something. And the thing with Season 2 was that 2000 was a big deal. After you broke 2000 you could play with some of the streamers and the guys who are pro now, like MegaZero. </p>
<p>JG: So you started rubbing elbows with people in the professional scene starting season 2?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, I'd say that. It took a while to get there, but it was definitely worth it when I got there. </p>
<p>JG: Alright, well what about season 3? Where did you finish off this last season?</p>
<p>JR: I broke into Diamond this season. It took a while, since pros kept smurfing and they would always end up on the enemy team and stomp the rest of my team, so I ended up getting into my promos three times before I got into Diamond, but it finally happened. </p>
<p>JG: Who did you play against? If you remember?</p>
<p>JR: My first series it was Locodoco and his support, I think. And then the second series  was lost by Boxbox. I hate that guy. </p>
<p>JG: But hey, you finally hit Diamond!</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, I did. Finally hit Diamond. It's actually great. I've gone from Gold, to Platinum, to Diamond.</p>
<p>JG: Challenger, here you come!</p>
<p>JR: Haha, that's the plan! </p>
<p>JG: Well now that seasons 3 has ended, what are your prospects for season 4?</p>
<p>JR: Well, first it's getting used to the new changes. Patch 3.14 I think it was.</p>
<p>JG: Patch Pi?</p>
<p>JR: Haha, yeah. Patch Pi. They really should've made the health pots into pies. I don't know why we didn't.</p>
<p>JG: We got biscuits instead.</p>
<p>JR: Eh, close enough. But it's really different. I'm still debating whether I want to keep playing seriously, mainly since Team Sparkle is starting to break up. </p>
<p>JG: Team... Sparkle?</p>
<p>JR: Oh, I never mentioned our name! Yeah, Team Sparkle. It started when we tried out Heroes of Newerth and we came up with a team name from two randomly generated words: "Spanky Inhibition." And when you put the two together for a team name it was sort of like "SPKL" and it looked like "Sparkle" so we became Team Sparkle. And we even had a chant, how'd it go...?</p>
<p>JG: I got to hear this.</p>
<p>JR: Sparkle, sparkle through the night. Sparkle, sparkle, oh so bright. Something... something... Go Team Sparkle... It was really dumb, but we'd always say it in between games. And we all moved into the condo we even named it the Sparkle House. </p>
<p>JG: Uh... Well then... But the team's breaking up?</p>
<p>JR: Yeah, we lost a few players. I did pick up a few high ELO people for a GatorLAN and we won, but Team Sparkle is falling apart. </p>
<p>JG: How's that going to affect seasons 4 for you?</p>
<p>JR: I mean as a team I don't think it's going to pick up again, with all of us in our later years of college starting to get busier, but I feel that when I have time, and if I feel ready, I'll be ready to tackle season 4. I might do GatorLAn, if the prizes get better, haha. But I haven't thought about it too much, since the new patch is pretty tough to get used to. Like the new trinkets? The hotkeys for that still mess me up.</p>
<p>JG: Well I showed you my videos about the patch, so I can help you with the changes if you need it.</p>
<p>JR: Haha, sounds like a plan.</p>
<p>JG: Alright Justin! Thanks for opening up and telling us all about your experiences as a League of Legends player. Hope you keep climbing!</p>
