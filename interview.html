    At the level of play I am currently involved with within League of Legends, I have had the ability to meet and interact with various professionals and experts for the game.

        Having played with well known players such as Aphromoo, ZionSpartan, and Dyrus has opened the doors for more connections. As such, I was able to inteview an old veteran of the game, who has been playing since closed beta. This man has seen the game transform from the small, single map MOBA it once was into the massive worldwide phenoemenon it is today.
