            Though I was born in Venezuela, I openly and wholeheartedly refer to myself as a Cuban. 
            
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            My family moved to the US shortly after my first birthday, so I do not have much memory of my Venezuelan homeland. My parents separated before the move, so leaving Venezuela meant leaving any chance for a Venezuelan culture, since I was now being raised solely by my Cuban family. For the last 20 years I have only known a Cuban household, Cuban cooking, and Cuban traditions. Though, admittedly, my grandparents tried to appeal a <en> little </en> to my inner Venezuelan blood, it didn't work. My taste palette is the only Venezuelan part of me.

            Though not by birth, I am indeed Cuban by blood. My demeanor, my Spanish accent, my cooking; I embody so much from the traditional Cuban household that many of my friends from Miami jest saying they don't have to miss home as long I'm around. I cook with various exotic spices. I blast Latin music in my car whenever I drive. I tend to curse in streams of Spanish rather than in English.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            I was not always this way, however. When I still lived with my family in Miami, I didn't particularly embrace the Cuban culture. Instead, I actually pushed it awaoy. I loved the food, no doubt, but never bothered to embrace the culture as a whole. The music, the dancing, the family-centered mentality. None if it really clicked until I left home. After living on my own for a few months, I didn't miss my home, per se, in that I didn't mind having to fend for myself. What I missed was my Cuban home.

            Entering my house and hearing Salsa music blasting throughout. Waking up to see my grandmother cleaning the house while dancing to some Merengue with the mop. Hearing my grandfather's infamous stream of Spanish curses when he stubbed his toe. I missed my culture. I missed being Cuban. It struck me so hard, I refused to believe it for a while. But it got to the point where I could no longer hold back my blood, and I openly embraced it. Since then, I have become what I like to see as a traditional Cuban-American. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My Cuban culture has become a major part of my life. And to think, it all started with a song.

            This song specifically.
